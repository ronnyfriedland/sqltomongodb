# sqltomongodb

## Introduction

Inspired by the migration tool [SQLToNoSQLImporter](https://github.com/msathis/SQLToNoSQLImporter) I started to create yet another [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) importer which can be configured and extended in a very easy way.

## Configuration

- provide docker container  
- more documentation
